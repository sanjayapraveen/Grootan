# Grootan
● Create an web portal
● This portal should have an text area to get any JSON input from user
● It should contain a button to process the JSON.
● If JSON is invalid an error should be shown to the user
● If JSON is valid, the JSON should be converted in corresponding
POJO class and should be shown in the portal
● The user should be given option to download the POJO class as a file
with ".java" extension
● Share the final source code via github
● Deploy the frontend and backend(if applicable) to any free hosting
service

As of the above given instructions I have created the web portal and attaching the file with this repository.
